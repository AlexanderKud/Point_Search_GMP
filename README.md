./generate_bloom uses multiple threads to fill in the bloomfilter binary.
to split the space evenly number of cores needs to be some power of two value.
actual number of processing cores but equal to some power of two value(2,4,8,16,32,64,...)
divided by 2
actual cores = 8  8 / 2 = 4 cores

./point_search is totally scalable and has no such restriction.
can set any desirable number of cores to use.
